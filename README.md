# Maple Hospital Script – Auto Farm, Troll, TP, Fly for Roblox



A maple hospital script roblox is a piece of code written in Lua (the scripting language used in Roblox) that automates or enhances gameplay. Instead of performing tasks manually—like healing patients, navigating rooms, or earning roleplay points—you can use a script to do all that instantly.
These scripts are especially popular among users who want to skip the repetitive parts of the game or simply explore the hospital in ways not normally possible.
